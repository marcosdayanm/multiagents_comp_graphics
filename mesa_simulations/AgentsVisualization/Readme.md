# Agent Visualization using WebGL 

This project is a simple demonstration of how to visualize the agents from mesa using WebGL. The server was ran using the environment provided in the repository.

## Instructions to run the local server and the Unity application

-  Run the flask server:

```
Server/tc2008B_flask.py
```

- The script is listening to port 8585 (http://localhost:8585). **Double check that your server is launching on that port.**
- If everything is running, the webpage should render a simple scene with cubes that are moving:
